* org-backlinks

An interface for searching backlinks to Org headings.

This package aims to provide a sense of context when searching for links /to/ and /from/ the current note.

Backlinks are the Org headings that have links to the current Org heading at point. Second order backlinks are the backlinks to each of the current heading's backlinks. Third order backlinks are the same but for the second order ones.

Optionally, it can also show the direct and indirect links of a note.

Direct links are the links to other headings present in the current heading. Indirect links are the direct links present in those headings.

The optional package =helm-org-backlinks= provides a Helm interface for =org-backlinks=.

This package requires [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]].


** Installation

Clone this repo and add it to your =load-path=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-backlinks")
(require 'org-backlinks)
(require 'helm-org-backlinks)    ; optional Helm interface
(require 'consult-org-backlinks) ; optional Consult interface
#+end_src

Or, with use-package + straight.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-backlinks
  :straight (org-backlinks :host github :repo "bcardoso/org-backlinks"
                           :files ("org-backlinks.el"))
  :bind ("C-c z" . org-backlinks))

;; optional Helm interface
(use-package helm-org-backlinks
  :straight (helm-org-backlinks :host github :repo "bcardoso/org-backlinks"
                                :files ("helm-org-backlinks.el"))
  :bind ("C-c z" . helm-org-backlinks))

;; optional Consult interface
(use-package consult-org-backlinks
  :straight (consult-org-backlinks :host github :repo "bcardoso/org-backlinks"
                                   :files ("consult-org-backlinks.el"))
  :bind ("C-c z" . consult-org-backlinks))
#+end_src


** Usage

Just run =M-x org-backlinks= or with the suggested binding =C-c z= in a Org heading.

Or run your preferred command: =M-x helm-org-backlinks= or =M-x consult-org-backlinks=.

=org-backlinks= will search the files defined by =org-backlinks-files= for the CUSTOM_ID or the ID of the current Org heading.

Set =org-backlinks-show-direct-links= to =t= to see both the direct and indirect links to other headings.

The other customizable variables are accessible through the customize interface:

- =M-x customize-group RET org-backlinks=.

For an all-purpose Org heading hopping interface, see [[https://github.com/bcardoso/org-hop][org-hop]].
